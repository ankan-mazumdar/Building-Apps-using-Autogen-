      "After running the modified code, you should be able to play the snake game with the new specifications. The snake will move at a normal speed and will grow longer each time it eats a bug. The bugs will appear randomly on the screen. The game will keep track of the score and end if the snake goes out of bounds or collides with itself. You can press Q to quit the game or C to play again after a game over.\n",
